# connect4
Beginner programming course final project

Written by Jericho Adalin and Quang Loc Tran

"This program is a simple rendition of the classic two-player game Connect-Four. Represented by the red pieces, the player user must place four markers in a row — either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — in order to win. Opposing the user is a simply coded AI with three difficulties, ranging from one to three, with one being the easiest."
